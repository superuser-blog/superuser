      <description>So the other day I had to create a CentOS 6 AMI for HDP installation as it had Hue package available only for CentOS 6. I launched an instance with EBS attached of 10 GB with CentOS 6. Went on to create AMI out of it with EBS size of 100GB.
These all went good and I proceed with launching instances for HDP cluster (12 was the number of instances). Everything went good and installation was complete.</description>
