Two Highschool friends started hacking around computers in the mid-&#8217;10s, the era of Yahoo Messenger, Windows Vista, 512MB RAM and Java-Enabled phones. Started from [TipToGeek.com](http://tiptogeek.com) and now we are here for a fresh start.

This is Parth. Good with FPGA, Firmware, Drivers and all the Hardware level stuff. Learning ASIC design at the moment. Can be found playing with Python. Tries NodeJS but prefers pure JavaScript on Chrome DevConsol.
