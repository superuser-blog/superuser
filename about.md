Two Highschool friends started hacking around computers in the mid-&#8217;10s, the era of Yahoo Messenger, Windows Vista, 512MB RAM and Java-Enabled phones. Started from [TipToGeek.com](http://tiptogeek.com) and now we are here for a fresh start.

This is Parth. R&D software engineer at [Keysight](https://keysight.com). Works on drivers, software plumbing, [p4](https://p4.org), and Kubernetes. Can be found playing with [p4](https://p4.org), Go, gRPC, and C++. Good with FPGA, low level system code, and all the hardware level stuff. Learned ASIC/FPGA design at university. Tries NodeJS but prefers pure JavaScript on Chrome DevConsol.
