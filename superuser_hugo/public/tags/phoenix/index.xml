      <description>About new Hadoop cluster we set up, the phoenix version bundled with HDP distribution(4.7) had some bugs which would make it impossible to use to run BI queries. There was no way provided by HDP to upgrade phoenix as we were using the latest version. Looking around on the internet, I found that manually we can replace the related jars and bins to have a new version in place.
So that&amp;rsquo;s what I tried.</description>
