      <description>As a part of migration from CDH cluster to HDP cluster, we also had to migrate OpenTSDBÂ which was running on CDH cluster. There are many methods to copy/transfer data between clusters and what we used here was ExportSnapshot.
So these are the steps roughly:
Stop TSDs Take snapshot(s) Transfer snapshots Restore snapshots Modify and start TSDs Steps 1 and 5 are self understood. We will look at how to take,transfer and restore snapshots.</description>
